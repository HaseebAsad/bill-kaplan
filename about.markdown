The Bill Kaplan Society was founded with the purpose to explore quantitative strategies in card games. Ever since the introduction of card games in casinos, players have tried to increase their competitive edge over the house and fellow competitors in any way possible to maximise winnings. Equipped with an understanding of the mathematics and probability behind each game, we believe that players have the opportunity to gain an advantage by mastering and applying this knowledge in their choice of card games. As a society, we explore this side of card games and produce our findings in this blog to provide a centralised source of all this information for readers.
