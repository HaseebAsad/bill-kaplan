Poker. Everyone's familiar with poker. A casino favourite turned competitive game, poker is synonymous with winning big.
But how can we understand the game better? As someone new to the game, how do you know when to fold or go all-in? In fact, perhaps the most pressing question of all is, is there any way a player can gain any advantage over their competitors, or is it all luck of the draw and your ability to bluff?

This society was found with the intention to better understand the answer to these questions, and provide the reader a guide to navigate different scenarios in a game, providing the fundamental basis for such strategies in mathematics and simulation.

*On a side note, the name for the society, Bill Kaplan, is in honour of the mathematician who successfully led a Harvard blackjack team in 1977 and later joined the famous MIT blackjack team.*
